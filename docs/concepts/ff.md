# Neural Network Implementation

This code defines a simple feedforward neural network with several layers and activation functions. Below is a brief explanation of the code and a check for any mistakes.

## Code Overview

1. The code imports the `torch` library for deep learning operations and defines some necessary types and functions.

2. It defines four classes:

   - `Linear`: Represents a linear layer in the neural network with weights and biases. It initializes the weights using Glorot initialization and can perform a forward pass.
   - `Sigmoid`: Represents the sigmoid activation function. It has a forward pass and a method to compute its gradient.
   - `TanH`: Represents the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function. It also has a forward pass and a method to compute its gradient.
   - `MSELoss`: Represents the mean squared error loss function, commonly used for regression tasks. It has a forward pass to compute the loss and a method to compute its gradient.

3. The `NeuralLayer` class defines a layer in the neural network, which includes a linear transformation and an activation function (either sigmoid or tanh). It also tracks the input, intermediate values, and output values for later use in the backward pass.

4. The `NeuralNetwork` class defines the neural network architecture. It consists of multiple `NeuralLayer` instances, and the architecture is specified by the number of input and output units, as well as a list of hidden layer sizes. The network uses tanh activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer. It includes methods for forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, gradient computation, weight updates, training, and prediction.

## Usage

The code appears to be free of syntax errors. However, it's important to note that the network architecture is fixed with tanh for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer, and the Glorot initialization method is used for weight initialization. You may need to customize it for your specific use case if you require different activations or weight initialization techniques.
